## 📊 Phase 3: Power BI Interactive Dashboard

This is the final stage where the cleaned data and SQL insights were transformed into an interactive visual story. The dashboard is designed to provide both high-level executive summaries and granular deep-dives.

### 🎨 Dashboard Structure
The report consists of a professional cover page and two main analytical pages:

1.  **Cover Page:** An introductory landing page featuring the project scope and navigation buttons to guide the user.
2.  **Global Overview:** * **Key KPIs:** Total layoffs, average percentage, and global impact.
    * **Geographic Insights:** Map visuals showing the most affected countries.
    * **Trend Analysis:** Line charts tracking layoffs over the years and months.
3.  **Analysis & Breakdown:**
    * **Decomposition Tree:** An advanced AI visual used to break down layoffs by Industry, Company Stage, and Location.
    * **Scatter & Comparison Charts:** Analyzing the relationship between Funding and Layoff intensity.

### 💡 Key Features Implemented:
* **Dynamic Navigation:** Custom buttons with hover effects for a seamless user experience (Ctrl + Click to navigate).
* **Slicer Panel:** Flexible filters for Industry, Country, and Date ranges without cluttering the UI.
* **Data Consistency:** Connected directly to the **SQL Final View** to ensure data integrity and automated formatting.
* **Smart Narratives:** Integrated AI summaries to provide instant text-based insights.
