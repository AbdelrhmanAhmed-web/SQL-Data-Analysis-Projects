### 📸 Final Data Preparation (SQL View)

After the cleaning process, I created a final **SQL View** to streamline the transition to Power BI.

* **Key Action:** Renamed all columns to clear, professional headers (e.g., `Total Laid Off`, `Funding in Millions`).
* **Purpose:** This view acts as the **"Clean Source"**, ensuring the dashboard stays connected to structured, error-free data without the need for further transformations inside Power BI.
